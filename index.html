				<h2>My Journal</h2>
				<p>I want to be a web designer. When I saw the BSIT curriculum,
					I looked forward to the Web Development subject because 
					I knew that this system is more focused on the frontend, 
					which I want to learn because I think I am capable in this. 
					However, I was wrong. At first, it was easy to recap and 
					learn HTML and CSS, but as time went by, it got harder 
					because the backend is complicated and hard to learn. 
					The pressure I felt every time I could not pass my 
					exercises made me stressed because it was my first time 
					experiencing this kind of situation, showing how difficult 
					programming is.</p>
				<p>Despite the stress and pressure, 
					I changed my perspective, realizing that the challenges 
					were an integral part of the learning process. 
					My passion for web design, particularly on the frontend, 
					only deepened as I grasped the intricacies of both 
					frontend and backend development. Amidst the challenges, 
					I found a supportive community within my classmates and 
					professor who shared a similar passion for web design. 
					I know it's still hard, and I am still learning, 
					but I want to learn more in this program.</p>
